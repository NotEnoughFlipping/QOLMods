# QOLMods
My own programmed QOLMods. Stay tuned for new mods, I will upload up to 1-3 mods per 1-2 months.

How to use this mod:

1. Download it from this github only, any other source is probably a scam and can get your account stolen.
2. Make sure you have Forge installed. If not, heres a how to guide for Forge: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPJQ4BgdwWQ
3. Now, put the mod in your mod folder. The standard path is C:\Users\Name\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\mods.
3.5. Be sure to put Skytils (BSMod) in a folder inside the mod folder. Just create a new one and drag it in there.
4. Now launch minecraft, and you're good to go! Enjoy coins until you cant anymore!

Now, you can either play the game normally or you can AFK on your island, but still monitor your game, since the lowest BIN for items like Livid Dagger, Necron Armor, Handles, etc..., items that have a lot of sales a day will appear in the chat and you have to click it. You will be redirected to the auction. BE SURE TO EAT A BOOSTER COOKIE!!!!!

If you're worried its a virus, heres the link to the VirusTotal site, which checks files for suspicious code: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e5e082d4fefec49bee9ab8869320f8e686e410773a80186ded4c340b3fc2edb6?nocache=1

This is free because it is new. Giving people an oppurtunity to be successfull in SkyBlock. If I see it becomes more popular and gets more users, i will probably make it cost like 4-5m in Skyblock coins
So, until that day, have fun!
